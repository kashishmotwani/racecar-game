## Features

A simple car racing game, that allows multiple user to play on the same server at the same time. It includes a log in page where users are allowed to enter a username and a password. Each user is randomly assigned a car and will commence a game with other players. The game has no collision-detection so the players can be creative with routes they take.


## Launching the game

The game can easily be launched by downloading the set files available on the repository and clicking on the `index.html` file. The game works on all browsers and is recommended to be viewed on full screen mode.

  ##### Requirements
  1. A functioning computer that has connection to the internet.
  2. A web browser.
  3. Node JS installed locally on the device that will allow for the multi-player capability.
  
  ##### How to play
  Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movements of the car. Follow the race track until the finish line (that is the same position where the car started at). The points will be split amongst the users in a game session. First arrivals get 3 points, cars that come in second position get 0 points and if there exist any third players, their cars that come in last will be awarded 0 points.

## Status

The game is officially completed and is ready to be used.
